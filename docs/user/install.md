## Installing PPanGGOLiN with Conda (recommended)

The best way to install PPanGGOLiN is through conda, accessible through the bioconda channel.
To ensure a smoother installation and avoid conflicting dependencies, it's highly recommended to create a dedicated environment for PPanGGOLiN:

```bash
# Install into a new conda environment
conda create -n ppanggo -c defaults -c conda-forge -c bioconda ppanggolin

# Check PPanGGOLiN install
conda activate ppanggo
ppanggolin --version
```

```{tip}
  For quicker installation and potential resolution of conflicting dependencies, consider using Mamba, an efficient alternative to conda.
```


## Installing from Source Code (GitHub)

### Within a Conda Environment

A straightforward method to install PPanGGOLiN from the source code is by utilizing a conda environment that includes all the necessary dependencies.

**1. Clone the PPanGGOLiN Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN.git
cd PPanGGOLiN
```

**2. Installing Dependencies with a Conda Environment File**

Install PPanGGOLiN dependencies listed in the [ppanggolin_env.yaml](../../ppanggolin_env.yaml) file, located at the root of the repository, using conda:

```bash
conda env create -n ppanggolin_source -f ppanggolin_env.yaml
```

**3. Installing PPanGGOLiN**

Finally, install PPanGGOLiN using **pip**:

```bash
pip install .
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install PPanGGOLiN without using conda, follow these steps:

```{warning}
Please note that this method involves manual installation. While assistance is available, complete troubleshooting support may not be provided. We strongly recommend using the conda installation method whenever possible.
```

**1. Clone the PPanGGOLiN Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN.git
cd PPanGGOLiN
```

**2. Installing PPanGGOLiN Dependencies**

To ensure the tool functions correctly, you need to install all dependencies listed in the [ppanggolin_env.yaml](../../ppanggolin_env.yaml) file.

Next, install the following non-Python software:

- [MMSeqs2>=13.45111](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki#installation)
- [Aragorn>=1.2.41](http://www.ansikte.se/ARAGORN/Downloads/)
- [Infernal>=1.1.4](http://eddylab.org/infernal/)
- [MAFFT>=7.505](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)

```{note}
- MMSeqs2 is crucial for gene clustering, while Aragorn and Infernal are used for genome annotation.
- MAFFT is utilized in the `ppanggolin msa` command for multiple sequence alignment.
- Skip installing Aragorn, Infernal, or MAFFT if you do not require their specific features.
```

**3. Installing PPanGGOLiN with its Python Dependencies**

PPanGGOLiN's Python dependencies are specified in the `pyproject.toml` file under the optional dependencies category named `python_deps`. This configuration file is situated at the root of the PPanGGOLiN repository.

To install PPanGGOLiN along with its Python dependencies, you can use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install .[python_deps]
```
